# Interactive

Interactive content is any content where we want to pause the players content either locally (on the player itself) or from an external source (scan of a QR code on a mobile device). Your content on the player will use the players API to setup the interactive session. Your scanURL is a url that phones will connect to to control the content displayed on the scanned device. For this you can use the interactive scan package produced.
